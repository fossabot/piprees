# Pip Rees

UI Designer & Front-End Developer

[Main site](https://piprees.dev/)

I've worked for local, government, and international clients developing
solutions with code, pixels, and ink.

I get inspired by new ideas and I love discovering age-old strategies and
wisdom. I know the value of designing for inclusivity right from the get-go, and
I take our user's needs seriously.

I never shy away from trying something different if it brings our team and the
business real value. I see constraints as an opportunity for innovative ideas to
flourish, and I love finding simple solutions to complex problems.
