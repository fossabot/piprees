          <p>In my previous role at CDSM, I worked to tight deadlines for demanding clients like Hwb, Mitsubishi, and Boots to create bespoke, professional E-Learning experiences and admin dashboards. I was hired as a Graphic Designer, became an E-Learning UI designer, and worked my way up to Front-End Developer.</p>
          <p>Before that, I helped small business clients to create easy to manage websites using WordPress and got to flex both my design and development skills creating custom themes to their specifications.</p>
