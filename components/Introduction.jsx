            I get inspired by new ideas and I love discovering age-old
            strategies and wisdom. I know the value of designing for inclusivity
            right from the get-go, and I take our user&apos;s needs seriously.
          </p>
          <p>
            I never shy away from trying something different if it brings our
            team and the business real value. I see constraints as an
            opportunity for innovative ideas to flourish, and I love finding
            simple solutions to complex problems.
